# Extracting pre-trained self-supervised embeddings for ICML ExVO 2022 challenge

This python code generates Generation SSL (WavLM) feature representation:

- Estimate frame-level SSL embeddings from pre-trained models
- Generates fixed-length feature representation by using mean and standard deviation functionals

The extracted feature representations were used during ICML ExVo 2022  challenge, for more details see:
